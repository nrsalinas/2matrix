2matrix.pl version 1.0 24 May 2013

2matrix.pl is a Perl script for merging and translating phylogenetic datasets. Input datasets can be either DNA/RNA/amino acid alignments (FASTA format) or morphological matrices (a xread file or a csv table, see below for the specification of the latter). Available output formats include xread, extended PHYLIP (RAxML) and NEXUS (the latter being compatible with Garli and MrBayes). Indel characters can be coded using the "simple" gap coding method of Simmons and Ochoterena (2000. Gaps as characters in sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. Systematic Biology 49: 369-381).



==================================================
REQUIREMENTS

Perl interpreter.

Systematic wisdom.

INSTRUCTIONS

If morphological characters are to be read from a .csv file, users should follow these formatting rules (see the example file "morphology-example.csv"):

a. Character states cannot consist of characters other than letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores. 

b. Each cell should contain the scores of a single character for a given taxon. Polymorphic entries should list the states separated by spaces. Missing values can be represented with either question marks or hyphens. 

c. The first column should contain taxon names, starting in the third row.

d. Character names should be placed in the first row, starting in the second column (first column will be discarded). Characters that may be problematic in TNT, Garli, MrBayes, or RAxML will be replaced with underscores (e.g. spaces, hyphens, and parentheses).

e. The second row should contain additivity information. If the character is non-additive, users should write either "non-additive" or "unordered" in this cell (case insensitive).  If the character is additive, the list of states ordered according the additivity sequence should be given. States should be separated by spaces in this list (e.g. "One_petal two_petals three_petals").

f. Do not include commas within the text of a cell.

g. Terminals are not required to be present in every input file and do not have to be listed in the same order.

EXAMPLE

A reconstruction of the matrix used by Doyle and Endress (2000. Morphological phylogenetic analysis of basal angiosperms: comparison and combination with molecular data. International Journal of Plant Sciences 161: S121-S153) is included in the distribution. The files morphology-example.csv and morphology-example.ss include the morphological data (csv and xread format, respectively), sequences are included in 18S-example.fasta, atpB-example.fasta, and rbcL-example.fasta. To create the combined matrix in TNT format, invoke the command:

2matrix.pl -i morphology-example.csv -i 18S-example.fasta -i atpB-example.fasta -i rbcL-example.fasta -s 18S -s atpB -s rbcL -o x -n example -d



==================================================
WARNINGS

2matrix assumes that the input files use the same new line characters as your operating system. Inconsistent use of new line characters will result in unusable output. Please pay particular attention to new line characters when moving files between computers or when using GUI programs on OS X and Windows.

Besides Garli 2.0 and MrBayes 3.2.1, NEXUS output is not guaranteed to be read and executed by any other program that accepts NEXUS files (e.g. PAUP 4b*).  

2matrix assumes that FASTA files contains DNA sequence if the sequences do not contain any E, F, I, L, O, P, Q, X, or Z positions. If the sequences are really amino acid, the output files cannot be read correctly. To force 2matrix to treat a file as amino acids, use the file extension .faa.  

Output xread files are generally readable by NONA, WincClada, TNT, etc., but files that contain amino acid sequences can only be read by TNT.
